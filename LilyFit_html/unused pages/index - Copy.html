                                 <p> The work was kept alive over the years by a small group of Joseph Pilates devoted students until just a few years ago, when exercise science caught up to the principles that Pilates had been teaching all along, and now we enjoy the rich evolution of the Pilates work that we have today.</p>

                                 <p> The work was kept alive over the years by a small group of Joseph Pilates devoted students until just a few years ago, when exercise science caught up to the principles that Pilates had been teaching all along, and now we enjoy the rich evolution of the Pilates work that we have today.</p>
                                 
                                 <p> Pilates is a form of exercise which emphasizes the balanced development of the body through  core strength, flexibility, and awareness in order to support efficient, graceful movement.</p>

                                       <p> The benefits of Pilates exercise that people report are that they become stronger, longer, leaner, and more able to do anything with grace and ease. All exercises are developed with modifications that can make a workout safe and challenging for a person at any level.</p>
                                       
                                       <p>  The Six Pilates Principles are Centering, Control, Flow, Breath, Precision, and Concentration. These six Pilates principles are essential ingredients in a high quality Pilates workout.</p>
                                 
                                     <p> Pilates exercises are done on either on a mat on the floor, Pilates mat work, or on exercise equipment developed by Joseph Pilates. </p>
